# BranchGenerator
This project is a script that randomly generate a branch and displays it. A "branch" is a weird data structure I came up with. I don't know why, I just thought it'd be interesting to try out.

## Project setup

Get into the project folder:
```bash
cd BranchGenerator
```

Create a new environment:

```bash
virtualenv --python="/usr/bin/python3" env
```

Get into that environment:

```bash
source env/bin/activate 
```

Install the librairies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run:

```bash
python3 app/src/main.py
```


## Versions

* Python 3.10.6
* Ubuntu 20.04.5

## Structure

```

env/
.gitignore
README.md
```
